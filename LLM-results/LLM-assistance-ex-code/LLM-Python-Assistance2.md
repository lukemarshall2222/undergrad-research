Prompt: can I reassign the method of a class in an if it originally raises a not implemented error

Yes, you can reassign the method of a class—even if the original method raises a NotImplementedError. In Python, methods are just attributes of a class or instance, so you can dynamically assign a new function to replace an existing one.
Here’s a quick example to illustrate this:

```python
class MyBase:
    def do_something(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("You must implement this method")

# Create an instance
obj = MyBase()

# Dynamically assign a method
def new_do_something(self):
    print("Now it's implemented!")

# Reassign the method on the class
MyBase.do_something = new_do_something

# Now calling the method works
obj.do_something()  # Output: Now it's implemented!

A few notes:
If you assign it to the class, all instances will use the new method.


If you assign it to the instance, only that specific instance will be affected:


import types
obj.do_something = types.MethodType(new_do_something, obj)

Want to apply this conditionally in a subclass or based on some runtime logic? You can do that too. Let me know your use case if you want help tailoring the approach.
how do you denote stdout in python?
In Python, stdout (standard output) is typically accessed via the sys module as sys.stdout. Here's how you can use it:
import sys

# Writing directly to stdout
sys.stdout.write("Hello, world!\n")

This is similar to using print(), but more low-level and gives you finer control (e.g. no automatic newline, customizable buffering, etc.).
Other common uses:
Redirecting output:

 with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
    sys.stdout = f
    print("This will go into output.txt")
sys.stdout = sys.__stdout__  # Restore default stdout


Capturing output (for testing or logging):

 from io import StringIO

buffer = StringIO()
sys.stdout = buffer
print("Captured output")
sys.stdout = sys.__stdout__

print("Buffer contained:", buffer.getvalue())
```


Let me know if you're working on something specific with stdout—happy to help!

Prompt: is there a way to call a method in python right after one of a subset of methods is called?

Yes, you can absolutely hook into method calls in Python and run something after one of a subset of methods is called. Here are a few ways you can do it, depending on how dynamic and clean you want your solution to be:

✅ 1. Manually wrap the target methods
If you know the method names in advance, wrap them in decorators that call your "after" method.
```python
def after_hook(method):
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        result = method(self, *args, **kwargs)
        self.after_any_hook()  # call the hook
        return result
    return wrapper

class MyClass:
    def after_any_hook(self):
        print("Hook called!")

    @after_hook
    def method_a(self):
        print("Doing A")

    @after_hook
    def method_b(self):
        print("Doing B")

    def method_c(self):
        print("C doesn't trigger hook")
```


🌀 2. Dynamically wrap a subset of methods
You can dynamically wrap only certain methods by name, useful if you're working with subclasses or plugins.

```python
def wrap_methods(cls, methods, hook_name):
    for name in methods:
        original = getattr(cls, name)
        def make_wrapper(method):
            def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
                result = method(self, *args, **kwargs)
                getattr(self, hook_name)()
                return result
            return wrapper
        setattr(cls, name, make_wrapper(original))

class MyClass:
    def after_any_hook(self):
        print(">> After hook")

    def method_a(self): print("A")
    def method_b(self): print("B")
    def method_c(self): print("C")

wrap_methods(MyClass, ["method_a", "method_b"], "after_any_hook")


🔥 3. Use __getattribute__ for full control
If you're feeling fancy and want any call to certain methods to automatically trigger a hook:
class MyClass:
    def after_any_hook(self):
        print(">> Hook!")

    def method_a(self): print("A")
    def method_b(self): print("B")
    def method_c(self): print("C")

    def __getattribute__(self, name):
        attr = super().__getattribute__(name)
        hook_methods = {"method_a", "method_b"}
        if callable(attr) and name in hook_methods:
            def hooked(*args, **kwargs):
                result = attr(*args, **kwargs)
                self.after_any_hook()
                return result
            return hooked
        return attr
```

This is powerful, but can be harder to debug if overused.

Let me know if you’re dealing with inheritance, plugins, or decorators, and I can help make it cleaner for that context.

Prompt: what would this do: 

def update_operators(method): 
def wrapper(self: Pipeline, *args, **kwargs): 
method(self, *args, **kwargs) 
self.set_next_and_reset() 
return wrapper

This update_operators function is a decorator that wraps a method of a class (presumably Pipeline) to automatically call self.set_next_and_reset() after the wrapped method is executed.
Let's break it down:
```python
def update_operators(method):
    def wrapper(self: Pipeline, *args, **kwargs):
        method(self, *args, **kwargs)  # call the original method
        self.set_next_and_reset()      # then call this hook method
    return wrapper

So what happens when you use it?
class Pipeline:
    def set_next_and_reset(self):
        print("Updating operators...")

    @update_operators
    def add_stage(self, stage):
        print(f"Adding stage: {stage}")

Now calling add_stage() will look like this under the hood:
pipeline = Pipeline()
pipeline.add_stage("Transform")
# Output:
# Adding stage: Transform
# Updating operators...
```

✅ Use Case
You'd use this if you want to ensure that whenever certain methods (like add_stage, remove_stage, etc.) are called, the pipeline updates itself afterward.
🧠 Little extra tip:
If you want to preserve metadata (like __name__, __doc__) from the original method, wrap it with functools.wraps:

```python
from functools import wraps

def update_operators(method):
    @wraps(method)
    def wrapper(self: Pipeline, *args, **kwargs):
        result = method(self, *args, **kwargs)
        self.set_next_and_reset()
        return result
    return wrapper

```

Let me know if you're trying to apply this to a bunch of methods automatically or conditionally—there are ways to do that cleanly too.

Prompt: so the method becomes the wrapper returned by the enclosing function?

Exactly! 🙌
When you use a decorator like @update_operators, Python essentially replaces the original method with the wrapper function returned by update_operators.
Here's the core idea:
```python
@decorator
def some_function(...):
    ...

Is the same as:
def some_function(...):
    ...

some_function = decorator(some_function)

So in your case:
@update_operators
def add_stage(self, stage):
    ...

Is equivalent to:
def add_stage(self, stage):
    ...

add_stage = update_operators(add_stage)
```

The result is that the original add_stage method is now wrapped inside the wrapper() function you defined, which:
Calls the original add_stage.


Then calls self.set_next_and_reset().


And yes, now add_stage is that wrapper function (with the original add_stage inside it).
If you're curious, you can even inspect it:
print(pipeline.add_stage.__name__)  # probably 'wrapper' unless you used @wraps

Let me know if you want to get fancier with stacking decorators or dynamically assigning them!

Prompt: how do you type returning self?

Great question! When a method returns self, and you want to type hint it properly, you generally use Self from the typing module (Python 3.11+). Here's how:

✅ Python 3.11+ (Best way)
from typing import Self

```python
class Pipeline:
    def add_stage(self, stage: str) -> Self:
        # ... do stuff ...
        return self


🧪 Python < 3.11 (Older way using TypeVar)
If you're using Python 3.10 or earlier:
from typing import TypeVar, Type

T = TypeVar("T", bound="Pipeline")

class Pipeline:
    def add_stage(self: T, stage: str) -> T:
        return self
```

This achieves the same result, but Self is cleaner and less boilerplate-y when you're able to use it.

Why bother?
Typing -> Self (or -> T) allows for method chaining to be correctly recognized by tools like:
linters (e.g., mypy)


IDEs (e.g., PyCharm, VSCode)


So this:
pipeline.add_stage("foo").add_stage("bar")

…won’t throw type errors, and you'll get proper autocompletion.

Let me know which Python version you're using, and I can give you the most optimized snippet for it.

Prompt: are there static methods in python?

Yep! Python absolutely has static methods, and they’re declared using the @staticmethod decorator.
🔹 What’s a static method?
A static method:
Belongs to the class, not to an instance.


Doesn’t receive the self or cls parameter automatically.


Is like a plain function that just happens to live inside a class.



🔧 How to define one
```python
class MyClass:
    @staticmethod
    def greet(name: str) -> str:
        return f"Hello, {name}!"

Now you can call it like this:
MyClass.greet("Alice")  # works fine
obj = MyClass()
obj.greet("Bob")        # also works, but no 'self'
```

🧠 When to use it
Use a @staticmethod when:
The method doesn’t need access to the instance (self) or class (cls).


You’re logically grouping functions inside a class for organization, but they don’t rely on class/instance data.

Want an example that contrasts all three? Or using them in a real-life class design?
can you type hint a tupele deconstruction in python
Yes! You can type hint tuple unpacking (deconstruction) in Python, though how you do it depends a bit on the context — whether you're doing it in a function signature, inside the body, or using match (with structural pattern matching).

✅ 1. In function parameters (Python 3.10+ with tuple unpacking directly)
While tuple unpacking in parameters is disallowed in function signatures in modern Python (was possible in Python 2), here's how you type the tuple and unpack manually inside:
from typing import Tuple

```python
def process_point(point: Tuple[int, int]) -> None:
    x, y = point  # unpacking
    print(f"x: {x}, y: {y}")
```


✅ 2. Using inline unpacking with type hints (Python 3.6+)
Python doesn't support this directly:
```python
# ❌ Not valid syntax
def func((x, y): Tuple[int, int]): ...
```

Instead, unpack inside and use Tuple[...] in the parameter or variable annotation:
```python
point: Tuple[int, int] = (5, 10)
x, y = point  # okay; x and y will be inferred as int
```


✅ 3. Using structural pattern matching (Python 3.10+)
```python
def handle_point(pt: Tuple[int, int]) -> None:
    match pt:
        case (x, y):
            print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}")
```

Here, x and y are inferred. You can use mypy to check types if needed.

✅ 4. Multiple return values with unpacking
You can also use this when returning and unpacking values:
```python
from typing import Tuple

def get_coords() -> Tuple[float, float]:
    return 1.0, 2.0

x, y = get_coords()  # x and y are floats
```


TL;DR
Use Tuple[...] for the full thing, and unpack after.


Python doesn’t let you deconstruct directly in function parameters with type hints.


You can still annotate the full variable or return type, then unpack it.
