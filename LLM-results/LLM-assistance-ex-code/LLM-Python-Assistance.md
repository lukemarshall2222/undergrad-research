can you deepcopy a emthod in python?
In Python, you can't deepcopy a method directly in the same way you deepcopy data structures like lists or dictionaries. When you try to copy.deepcopy() a method, Python doesn't create a new method object ‚Äî it usually just keeps a reference to the same one, especially for bound methods (methods attached to an instance).
Why?
Methods are tied to the class and the instance they belong to. So copying them doesn‚Äôt really make sense in most use cases ‚Äî their behavior is defined by their class and the instance context.
Example:
import copy

class MyClass:
    def method(self):
        print("Hello")

obj = MyClass()
method_copy = copy.deepcopy(obj.method)

print(method_copy is obj.method)  # True

This prints True, showing it‚Äôs not a true deep copy ‚Äî it‚Äôs the same method.
If you really want to clone method logic:
You can copy the function underneath the method (i.e., the __func__), but even then, you're not changing its logic ‚Äî just referencing it.
func_copy = copy.deepcopy(obj.method.__func__)

But again, deepcopy usually won't actually clone the function logic ‚Äî functions are considered immutable in Python, so it just returns the same object.

What are you trying to do?
If you're trying to dynamically modify or duplicate behavior, maybe decorators or dynamic class creation might be better suited. Let me know the context and I‚Äôll help you find a better approach.
I am trying to save the current method inside an object as an enclosed value that can be used in a returned function

Ah, gotcha ‚Äî so you‚Äôre trying to capture a method‚Äôs current behavior and stash it somewhere, like a snapshot, so you can use it later even if the object‚Äôs method changes?
You‚Äôre actually on the right track thinking about closures. Here‚Äôs how you can do it, with an example:

‚úÖ Capturing a method's behavior with a closure
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 10

    def method(self):
        return self.value

    def save_current_method(self):
        saved = self.method  # This captures the current bound method

        def wrapper():
            return saved()  # Uses the captured method

        return wrapper

Usage:
obj = MyClass()
saved_func = obj.save_current_method()

obj.value = 20
print(saved_func())  # Still returns 20, because it's calling the method live

But if you want to preserve the behavior at that moment, you can capture the method's output or copy the unbound function + instance:

üíæ Capturing the actual behavior at that point
If you want a literal snapshot of what it would do right now, you can do this:
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 10

    def method(self):
        return self.value

    def save_snapshot(self):
        result = self.method()  # Capture the result now

        def wrapper():
            return result  # Always returns the captured value

        return wrapper

Now:
obj = MyClass()
snap = obj.save_snapshot()

obj.value = 99
print(snap())  # ‚Üí 10


üîÅ Want the function to keep working even if the method is changed later?
You can also stash the function itself (not the method):
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 10

    def method(self):
        return self.value

    def save_function(self):
        func = self.method.__func__  # Unbound function
        instance = self

        def wrapper():
            return func(instance)  # Manually call with current self

        return wrapper

This way it won't be affected by method reassignment like self.method = lambda: 42.

Let me know if you're trying to preserve state, behavior, or deal with dynamic reassignment ‚Äî each one has its own trick.
i want it to remain even when the method of the class changes, i will assign the returned value as the new method
Ahhh okay ‚Äî now we‚Äôre cooking. You want to capture the current behavior of a method, and then restore or reuse it later even if the class or instance method is overridden.
Let‚Äôs walk through how to snapshot the current method behavior, wrap it, and then assign it back as the method later. This is doable ‚Äî we just need to detach the method logic from its future context.

‚úÖ Full Example: Save Method Snapshot, Assign Later
import types

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 10

    def method(self):
        return self.value

    def snapshot_method(self):
        # Capture the unbound function and the current instance
        func = self.method.__func__  # Unbound function
        bound_self = self  # Instance to keep behavior tied to current state

        # Make a new method bound to the same instance and logic
        return types.MethodType(func, bound_self)

Usage:
obj = MyClass()
saved_method = obj.snapshot_method()

# Now change the original method
obj.method = lambda: 42

print(obj.method())        # ‚Üí 42
print(saved_method())      # ‚Üí 10, uses the original method logic & self


ü™Ñ Assign the snapshot back as a method
You can even do:
obj.method = saved_method
print(obj.method())  # ‚Üí 10

Now obj.method() behaves like the original again.

Summary
Use __func__ to get the original function without bindings.


Use types.MethodType(func, instance) to re-bind it safely.


This ensures it still uses the original self, even if the method is later replaced.


Let me know if you want to generalize this to multiple methods, or preserve state too!
is there a record type in python?
Not exactly by that name, but Python has a few built-in and standard library tools that work like a "record type" ‚Äî something with named fields you can access like attributes. Here are the main options, depending on what you need:

üîπ 1. namedtuple (from collections)
Immutable, lightweight, tuple-like.
from collections import namedtuple

Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
p = Point(1, 2)

print(p.x)  # 1
print(p.y)  # 2


üîπ 2. dataclass (since Python 3.7+)
More flexible and readable. Mutable, supports default values, type hints, methods, etc.
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Point:
    x: int
    y: int

p = Point(1, 2)
print(p.x)  # 1
p.y = 10    # Allowed: it's mutable

You can make it immutable too:
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Point:
    x: int
    y: int


üîπ 3. types.SimpleNamespace
Super lightweight, basically like a dictionary with dot-access.
from types import SimpleNamespace

p = SimpleNamespace(x=1, y=2)
print(p.x)  # 1
p.y = 10    # mutable


TL;DR: Which one to use?
Use Case
Recommended Option
Immutable, lightweight
namedtuple
Mutable, structured w/ features
@dataclass
Super lightweight + dynamic
SimpleNamespace

If you're coming from a language like TypeScript, F#, or Rust and you're looking for something like a "record" ‚Äî dataclass is the closest native equivalent.

How do you overload the | operator in python
Ah, nice ‚Äî the | operator is definitely overloadable in Python, and it's a cool way to give your objects custom behavior for "pipe" or "union" style operations.
üîß Overloading | in a Class
You do this by defining the special method __or__.
Here‚Äôs a simple example:
class MyThing:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __or__(self, other):
        return MyThing(self.value + other.value)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"MyThing({self.value})"

Usage:
a = MyThing(10)
b = MyThing(5)
c = a | b

print(c)  # MyThing(15)


üîÅ Also: __ror__ for the reverse case
Python will call __ror__ if the left operand doesn‚Äôt know how to handle the |. This is useful if you want your object to be used on the right side of the pipe.
class MyThing:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __ror__(self, other):
        return MyThing(other + self.value)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"MyThing({self.value})"

Now you can do:
result = 5 | MyThing(3)  # MyThing(8)
print(result)


Bonus: Python already uses | for‚Ä¶
Sets: set1 | set2 ‚Üí union


Dictionaries (3.9+): dict1 | dict2 ‚Üí merged dict


Bitwise OR: 5 | 2 ‚Üí 7 (binary OR)


So it can be semantically cool to use | for combining, merging, piping, etc.
Want to do a full-blown pipeline like in functional programming? I can show how to chain callables with | too.
